# Prachi Thakur — Portfolio Website (GitHub Pages)

This is a lightweight, static portfolio website designed for **Finance, Fraud & IT Risk Analytics** positioning.

## What’s inside
- `index.html` — single-page site (fast, recruiter-friendly)
- `styles.css` — fixed, consistent project theme
- `script.js` — minimal JS (year auto-update)
- `assets/` — place images here (e.g., one combined company strip)

## Add the single company image (optional)
Place one collage/banner image here:

- `assets/company-strip.png`

The site will render it at the top of the Work Experience section.

## Deploy for free on GitHub Pages
1. Create a GitHub repo (or use an existing one)
2. Upload these files to the repo root
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/(root)**
5. Save — your site will be available at the GitHub Pages URL

## Notes
- Projects without GitHub use simple diagrams/tables only (no synthetic dashboards).
- Replace placeholders like “(Dates from resume)” with exact dates from your resume when ready.
